<h2>Static Abstract Execution from Programs to Models</h2>

<h3>Speaker</h3>

<p>A/Prof. Yulei Sui, UNSW</p>

<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>Static analysis has long served as an important basis for program reasoning and verification, enabling the extraction and interpretation of abstract representations of software systems. This talk explores how the principles of static analysis, as developed in our SVF framework, can be extended beyond traditional code analysis to areas such as abstract execution of AI models. As part of this ongoing effort, we are developing the ACT tool, which applies static reasoning to the analysis and verification of neural networks. It builds on the shared foundations between program analysis and neural network verification, both grounded in abstraction and symbolic reasoning over large input spaces. Our early findings indicate that static reasoning techniques provide useful insights for improving the reliability and robustness of modern AI systems.</p>
