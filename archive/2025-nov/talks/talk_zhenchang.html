<h2>Reshaping Requirements Engineering in the AI Era</h2>

<h3>Speaker</h3>

<p>Dr. Zhenchang Xing, Data61 CSIRO</p>

<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>AI is reshaping requirements engineering (RE). This talk argues that neither traditional RE nor emergent LLM-only, spec-driven workflows deliver the rigor and value systems demand. I present an AI-native method that fuses neural reasoning with symbolic engineering to keep human intent central, generate diverse yet verifiable user stories, and iteratively refine product scope with evidence. Using cause-effect graphs, Gherkin revisions, and Kano analysis, the approach exposes ambiguity, enforces clear “done” criteria, and trims feature creep by prioritizing user satisfaction. A short demo will showcase our tool for user requirements generation and analysis, illustrating how neuro-symbolic synergy elevates RE practice.</p>
